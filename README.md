Starting from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this is the **React** repo of the [React + Rails API Authentication](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgYiyoyNPrv_yNp5Pzsx0A3gQ8-tfg66j) course (the Rails repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jro31/rails-authentication)), and includes commits of examples of:

* Part 5 - [Generating and Configuring the React JS Authentication Application](https://youtu.be/ZAu_7tQnXTo) (note that I used 'Create React App', rather than the project used in the video)
  * Adding `react-router-dom` and `axios`, and creating the `Home` and `Dashboard` components and adding their routes - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-auth-app/commit/98ffef487d612763ff33fae9c8316c2f35d94370)
    * Note that I installed version 5 of `react-router-dom` (with `npm install react-router-dom@5`) because version 6 has removed the `Switch` component being used in the tutorial
